# FrSkyGps_D

Retrieve position data from a serial GPS module (e.g. U-Blox M8N) and send it as telemetry data to your Taranis.

Based on NeoGPS (https://github.com/SlashDevin/NeoGPS) and the FrSky telemetry library from here https://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showpost.php?p=32238677

Default configuration is:

 * U-Blox M8N on pins 8&9 (as assumed by AltSoftSerial)
 * FrSky RX on pin 3
